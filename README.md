# DrawKanjiOcr
This WPF application lets you write a Kanji character with a mouse or drawing tablet. It then detects which character or series of characters you wrote and outputs it as a string of text. This is intended to make looking up the meanings and readings of these characters easier.

I made it for use with Kanji, but it will detect any hand writing that Google Cloud Vision can parse.
